1st problem:
This code creates a function named alphabet(x) that takes a word and sorts its letters in alphabetical order. The sorted(x) part arranges the letters from A to Z. Then, the join() part puts those sorted letters back together into a single word. When we use this function with the word "joshua", it changes it to "ahjosu".

2nd Problem 
This code changes emotion words like "Smile" and "Sad" into smiley faces or sad faces. It uses a dictionary called emo_dict that matches words to their emoticons, like "Smile" to ":)". The code then checks each word in a sentence and replaces it with the matching emoticon using the replace() function. When you give it the sentence "I'm Mad", it changes "Mad" to ">:(" and prints "I'm >:(".

3rd Problem
This code takes a list of numbers and splits it into three parts. The first number goes into a variable called first, the last number goes into last, and all the numbers in between go into a list called middle. The *middle part is what lets the middle numbers be collected into a list. After splitting, the code prints the values of first, middle, and last.
